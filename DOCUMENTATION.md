[!TIP] 
when you have already written the correct data, the next time you start the program, you will be asked: "whether to load the data" , if so, you will quickly log into mysql, otherwise you will write new data (if incorrectly entered data, database.properties will not be updated)

# package console
<ol>
<li> main_code_console -> main class for work with console
</ol>

# package console
<ol>
<li> core_console -> main part for work with console
<li> sql_console -> this class executes sql queries
<li> helper_console -> ???
</ol>

# package DB

<li> helper_for_util -> there are many methods that using in util class
<li> util -> setup and connection to base date
